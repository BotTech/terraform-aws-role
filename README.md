# terraform-aws-role

https://registry.terraform.io/modules/BotTech/role/aws/

Terraform module for AWS which creates an IAM role.

The quickest way to get started is to refer to one of the examples above ðŸ‘†.

## Configuration

### Groups

Create any groups that you may need:

```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_iam_group" "developers" {
  name = "Developers"
}
```

### Policies

Also create policies that you want to be attached to the role:

```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_iam_policy" "developer" {
  description = "Allow a user to develop applications."
  name        = "Developer"
  policy      = data.aws_iam_policy_document.developer.json
}

// Policy document not shown.
```

## Module

Now that you have all the prerequisites you can configure the module:

```hcl-terraform
module "developer_role" {
  source  = "BotTech/role/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"

  account_ids = [
    data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id,
    var.parent_account_id
  ]
  description = "Provides developer access to resources."
  groups = [
    aws_iam_group.developers.name
  ]
  name        = "CommUnityDeveloper"
  policies    = {
    resources = aws_iam_policy.developer.arn
    ecr       = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser"
  }
}
```
